            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>A tech enthusiast and mentor on a mission:</strong> A young changemaker who is
                purposefully
                leveraging his passion for technology and mentorship to address societal needs and create meaningful
                impact. I’m all about merging personal strengths with professional aspirations, blending what I love
                with what the world truly needs to drive positive change in my community and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at the African Leadership
                University in Rwanda, where we thrive in an innovative learning environment emphasizing mission over
                major. Alongside my studies, I'm interning as a Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) at Never
                Again Rwanda, a peace-building organization dedicated to promoting sustainable peace and development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, here's where things get a little jazzy, literally. Away from my pc screen, I channel my creativity
                into music. Whether it’s tickling the ivories on a piano, beating rhythms on drums, or mastering my
                saxophone, music is my playground for expression and balance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fueled by a commitment to mentorship and community impact, I’m always on the lookout for opportunities
                to inspire others and turn technology into a force for good. Life’s a symphony, and I’m playing my
                part—coding by day, jamming my musical instruments by night, and mentoring along the way!.

            <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
            <p>
                I joined the AltSchool program to gain hands-on experience in engineering practices, particularly in
                backend engineering. I was drawn by the opportunity to learn from a vibrant community of tech
                enthusiasts and gain industry-ready skills.
