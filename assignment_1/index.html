            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>A lifelong learner on a mission:</strong> I'm a young changemaker who is purposefully
                leveraging his passion for technology and mentorship to address societal needs and create meaningful
                impact. It's all about merging my personal strengths with my professional aspirations, blending what I
                love
                with what the world truly needs to bring change.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in software engineering at the <a
                    href="https://www.alueducation.com/">African Leadership University</a> in
                Rwanda, a leadership-oriented learning environment which emphasises mission over major. Alongside my
                studies, I'm interning as a Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) at <a
                    href="https://neveragainrwanda.org/">
                    Never
                    Again Rwanda
                </a>, a peace-building organization dedicated to promoting sustainable peace and development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's where things get a little jazzy. Away from my pc screen, I channel my creativity into music.
                Whether playing my piano and getting lost in the melody, dishing out some grooves on the drums, or
                practising my saxophone, music is my escape—a place where I express myself and find balance.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm always on the lookout for opportunities
                to inspire others and turn technology into a force for good. Life's a symphony, and I'm playing my
                part—coding by day, jamming my musical instruments by night, and mentoring along the way!

            <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
            <p>
                I joined the AltSchool program to gain hands-on experience in engineering practices, particularly in the backend engineering track. I'm also leveraging the opportunity of its vibrant community filled with like minds. I am convinced that I'll find those people who can join me in building solutions with the industry-ready skills we will gain here at AltSchool.
